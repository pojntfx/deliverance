## Overview

> **Deliverance**: The ship assigned to carry [Hari Seldon and his Foundation](https://foundation.fandom.com/wiki/Deliverance) to colonize the planet Terminus

Deliverance is a minimal (a single `Makefile`) digital publishing system that intents to make distributing self-contained documents, whether these are study notes, research papers, lab reports or even a bachelor's thesis, trivial. It has been in use for multiple years to create reports and study materials at [Media University Stuttgart](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/index_html).

It enables you to:

- **Publish using Markdown**: By using the well-supported Markdown format as its input language, Deliverance easily fits into your existing workflow.
- **Support many output formats without complicated configuration**: By default, Deliverance builds into many output formats at once - including PDF, HTML, EPUB, TXT, Gemini, ODT, DOCX, various slide formats and more!
- **Create self-contained and reproducible documents**: Deliverance creates fully self-contained and self-documenting outputs, including the full Git changelog, source repo URL, source code itself and more.
- **Integrate with CI/CD systems**: By using the Deliverance GitHub action, you can easily publish your documents to GitHub pages or other hosts.
- **Use LaTeX and BibTeX features**: Thanks to its internal use of `pandoc`, Deliverance can be used for scientific publishing.

## Tutorial

> TL;DR: Create a `configure` script, write your documents in Markdown, and publish to the web with the GitHub action

**Prefer starting with an starter project? Check out the [examples](#examples)!**

### 1. Setting Up Your Repo

First, create a new repository. On GitHub, you can do this by heading to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new), but you can also create a local repo using `git init`. After you've cloned or initialized your repo, create the `configure` script in it and make it executable:

```shell
$ tee > configure <<EOT
#!/bin/sh

curl -LO https://github.com/pojntfx/deliverance/releases/latest/download/Makefile
EOT
$ chmod +x configure
$ tee > .gitgnore <<EOT
out
Makefile
EOT
```

Once you've done that, you can use it to download the latest Deliverance `Makefile` and download the dependencies:

```shell
$ ./configure
$ make depend
```

Now, add a `LICENSE` file, a `README.md` etc. - you can find examples for this in [examples](#examples).

### 2. Writing Your Documents

Your Markdown documents should be in the `docs` folder; you can put any static assets, such as pictures, references or quotation styles, into `static/docs` - for example, you can start with this document in `docs/main.md`:

```markdown
---
author: [Felicitas Pojtinger]
date: "2023-01-28"
subject: "Uni Webdev Backend Summary"
keywords: [webdev-backend, hdm-stuttgart]
subtitle: "Summary for the webdev backend course at HdM Stuttgart"
lang: "de"
---

### Contributing

These study materials are heavily based on [professor Toenniessen's "Web Development Backend" lecture at HdM Stuttgart](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/bibliothek/studieninteressierte/bachelor/block?sgname=Mobile+Medien+%28Bachelor%2C+7+Semester%29&sgblockID=2573378&sgang=550041&blockname=Web+Development+Backend) and prior work of fellow students.

\newpage

## Themen der Vorlesung

1. **EinfÃ¼hrung in Node.js** und einfache HTML-Fileserver
2. **RESTful Endpoints** mit Express.js
3. Die Template-Engine **EJS** und **Express-Sessions**
4. Datenbanken mit **MongoDB und Mongoose**
```

Depending on the type of document you want to write, you might also benefit from including an abstract, bibliography or more - you can find examples for this in [examples](#examples).

Once you've added your starter document (you can also add multiple ones), you can start iterating on it by running `make dev-pdf/main` - this will start compiling your notes to a PDF file on each change. You can then use `make open-pdf/main` to open the PDF file, or iterate on one of the other formats by using `make dev-html/main`, `make dev-txt/main` - there are many other `make` targets available as well, so be sure to check these out with `make <tab>`.

### 3. Publishing To The Web

To publish to the web, you can either run `make` and upload the `out/release.tar.gz` archive to your web server of choice, or use the provided GitHub action by adding the following to `.github/deliverance.yaml`:

```yaml
name: Deliverance CI

on:
  push:
  pull_request:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0"

jobs:
  build-linux:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout, build and publish with Deliverance
        uses: pojntfx/deliverance@latest
        with:
          github_token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
```

After you've added this file, push to your repo, enable GitHub pages for the `gh-pages` branch and your documents should be accessible to everyone with an internet connection. Here is an example of a published document: [uni-supply-chain-paper](https://pojntfx.github.io/uni-supply-chain-paper/)

**ðŸš€ You're all set to publish your documents!** We can't wait to see what you're going to share with Deliverance.
